### This is file stripe82calibStars_v4.1.dat created on December 20, 2020.
###  
### This version (4.1) ONLY INCLUDES GRAY CORRECTIONS based on Gaia EDR3.
### The version with Gaia-based ugiz color corrections is v4.2! 
### 
### A catalog of 991,472 standard stars from SDSS stripe 82.
###
### This catalog is a revised version of the catalog described in 
### Ivezic et al. 2007 (Astronomical Journal, 134, 973). The main 
### differences include:
### - due to additional SDSS data, about twice as many epochs are used 
###    in photometric averaging, resulting in about 30% smaller random 
###    photometric errors
### - systematic photometric zeropoint errors, as functions of RA and
###    Dec are estimated and corrected for using Gaia EDR3 photometry.
###
### Processing details and catalog analysis are discussed in 
###  Thanjavur et al. (2021). 
### 
### The selection steps for this catalog include: 
###  1) star is listed in the original 2007 catalog (v2.6)
###  2) the star remained non-variable (chi2 < 3 in gri); 
###  this version includes 98.5% stars from the original (v2.6) catalog
###
### There is one line per star, and each line lists (in this order):
###  0) every line starts with the string CALIBSTARS_ID, where ID is the
###     star's sequential listing number from the v2.6 catalog
###  1) RA Dec RArms Decrms: the mean position and its rms per coordinate,
###     this is J2000, decimal degrees for RA and Dec, and arcsec for rms
###     NB: standard errors can be computed as rms/sqrt(Ntot)
###  2) Ntot: the total number of epochs
###  3) Ar: the Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) ISM extinction value in 
###     the r band; extinction in other bands can be computed as [Rv=3.1]: 
###     Am = Cm*Ar, with Cm=(1.873, 1.377, 0.758, 0.537) for m=(ugiz) 
###  4) and then in each band (ugriz, in this order):
###       (Nobs mmed mmu msig mrms mchi2), which are: 
###       the total number of observations in this band
###       the median magnitude 
###       the mean magnitude
###       the standard error for the mean (1.25 larger for the median)
###       the root-mean-square scatter
###       chi2 per degree of freedom (computed using the mean magnitude)

### **** IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT **** 
###  1) To select sources with reliable photometry in the u and z bands
###     don't forget to require Nobs >= 4
###  2) to avoid a slight bias (~0.02 mag) at the faint end in the gri  
###     bands, require msig*sqrt(Nobs) < 0.03
