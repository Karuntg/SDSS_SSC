% \section{The Construction and Analysis of the New v3.4 Catalog \label{sec:v34}}


%%%% COPY BELOW TO OVERLEAF as zeljko2.tex 

We first describe the construction of the new SDSS catalog and derivation of photometric
zeropoint corrections using Gaia DR2 data, and then compare the resulting photometry to 
Gaia DR2, DES, Pan-STARRS and CFIS catalogs. 

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The construction of raw SDSS catalog from light curves \label{sec:averaging}} 

Given light curve data files described in Section~\ref{ssec:DR15}, we computed the median 
and mean magnitudes, their formal uncertainties and $\chi^2$ (assuming constant brightness)
for all stars, in all five bands. Due to more observational epochs in DR15, the new data are more 
sensitive to variability; following \pO, we applied $\chi^2>3$ in the $gri$ bands, as well as  
requirements for at least 4 epochs in the same three bands and the formal uncertainty of the 
mean $r$ band magnitude below 0.05 mag. These selection criteria recovered 98.5\% stars from
the original catalog, resulting in a new catalog with 991,472 stars. 

Figure~\ref{fig:rerr_nvso} compares the numbers of epochs for matched stars and their formal
uncertainties of the mean $r$ band magnitude. The new 2020 catalog has about 2-3 times more 
measurements per star, depending on its sky position within Stripe 82. Consequently,  formal 
photometric uncertainties (``random errors'') are about 1.4-1.7 times smaller. This raw catalog
is labeled version v3.1, and is publicly available from the same
website\footnote{http://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/sdss/catalogs/stripe82.html} 
as the original 2007 catalog. 

A star-by-star comparison of the photometry between the old and new catalogs is discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:v26v34}.

\subsection{The derivation of  photometric zeropoint corrections using Gaia DR2 data\label{sec:GaiaCorr}} 

The variation of photometric zeropoints with position on the sky in the \pOc\ (see their eq.~4) was 
constrained using a combination of stellar colors \citep[the principal axes in color-color diagrams, for details 
see][]{2004AN....325..583I} and a standard star network \citep{2002AJ....123.2121S}. It is likely that 
residual errors in zeropoint calibration (e.g., a saw-tooth pattern, as a function of Declination,
was reported by \citealt{2013A&A...552A.124B}; see their Fig.~23) can be further minimized using 
uniformly calibrated space-based photometry from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). 

\subsubsection{Positional matching of the SDSS and Gaia catalogs}
Naively, one would positionally match the SDSS and Gaia DR2 catalogs using a matching radius of 
about 0.3 arcsec because SDSS positions are accurate to better than 0.1 arcsec per coordinate (rms) 
for sources with $r < 20.5$ mag \citep{2003AJ....125.1559P}.  However, observational epochs are
sufficiently different that stellar proper motions need to be accounted for; indeed, we find a very 
strong correlation between the SDSS-Gaia positional differences and proper motions published in 
the Gaia DR2 catalog (see the left panel in  Figure~\ref{fig:GaiaRApm}). After accounting for proper
motions,  the positions agree at the level of $\sim28$ milliarcsec (robust\footnote{We use robust estimator 
of standard deviation computed as $\sigma_G = 0.741*(q_{75}-q_{25})$, where $q_{25}$ and $q_{75}$ are 
the 25\% and 75\% quantiles, and the normalization factor 0.741 assures that $\sigma_G$ is equal to 
standard deviation for normal (Gaussian) distribution.}
rms, per coordinate). The 
residual differences are dominated by systematic errors in SDSS astrometry because there is
no increase of this rms with magnitude (see the right panel in Figure~\ref{fig:GaiaRApm}), and
because the contribution of Gaia's astrometric measurement uncertainties is negligible. 
The implied SDSS astrometric accuracy of $\sim28$ milliarcsec is substantially better than 
``$<0.1$ arcsec reported by \cite{2003AJ....125.1559P}, but note that here we used 
positions ``averaged'' over typically $\sim20$ SDSS runs (see the left panel in Figure~\ref{fig:rerr_nvso}).

where $\sigma_G$ is the robust standard deviation. The right panel shows the R.A. difference 
after correcting using the best-fit R.A. difference vs. 
proper motion curve, as a function of the SDSS $r$ magnitude. The residual differences are dominated 
by systematic errors in SDSS astrometry at the level of $\sim28$ milliarcsec (note that there is no increase with 
magnitude). Analogous plots for Declination quantities are similar.

\subsubsection{Gaia-based photometric zeropoint corrections  \label{sec:GaiaCorr2}}

Gaia DR2 reported Gmag magnitudes, which approximately span the SDSS $griz$ bandpasses, 
and BP and RP magnitudes, which approximately correspond to the blue and red halfs of the 
Gmag bandpass. We first used Gmag data to derive ``gray'' zeropoint corrections (applied to
all five SDSS bands), and then use the BP-RP color to derive zeropoint corrections for the 
$ugiz$ bands, relative to the $r$ band. 

The basic idea is simple: use Gaia's Gmag, Gmag$_{GaiaDR2}$, and the SDSS $gri$ magnitudes
to derive synthetic Gmag magnitudes based on SDSS data, Gmag$_{SDSS}$; bin the 
$\Delta$Gmag = (Gmag$_{SDSS}$-Gmag$_{GaiaDR2}$) residuals by R.A. and Dec, and 
use the median residuals per bin as the gray correction for SDSS photometry (as functions
of R.A. and Dec). Similarly, use Gaia's BP-RP color to derive synthetic $u-r$, $g-r$, $r-i$
and $r-z$ colors, and used the median residuals per bin as zeropoint corrections for 
the $ugiz$ bands. 

Given a large number of matched stars ($\sim 400,000$), and a large number of color combinations,
we do not attempt to derive analytic fits for synethtic magnitudes and colors but instead
use 0.05 mag narrow color bins and linear interpolation between the bins. We have verified
that even sixth-order polynomial fits do not provide better results than this simple 
numerical approach. An example of such a transformation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GrVSgi}. 


\begin{figure}[th!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/GrVSgi.png} 
\caption{The variation of the difference between Gaia's Gmag magnitude from Data Release 2
and SDSS $r$ magnitude with the SDSS $g-i$ color.
The  color map illustrates the distribution of $\sim 393,000$ matched stars with 
$16<$Gmag$<19.5$. The two (barely distinguishable) solid lines represent the median 
values $\pm$ uncertainty of the median for 0.05 mag wide $g-i$ bins. The short-dashed 
lines show the median values $\pm$ the robust standard deviation for 
each bin. The horizontal solid line at zero is added to guide the eye. The mean of 
the two solid lines is used to derive the gray zeropoint correction, as a function of R.A.
and Declination.}
\label{fig:GrVSgi}
\end{figure}


The variation of Gmag residuals with Gmag (see Figure~\ref{fig:gaiaJump}) shows two 
interesting features. First, there is a sharp
``jump'' by about 3 millimag at Gmag$\sim$16.  This jump was a known (and 
larger problem) in Gaia Data Release 1, but appears not entirely fixed in DR2. The 
second ``feature'' is a large ($\sim0.01-0.02$ mag) discrepancy at the faint end:
about $\sim$10 millimag at Gmag=19.5 and $\sim$20 millimag at Gmag=20.5. 
A comparison of the SDSS catalog with Pan-STARRS and DES catalogs (see 
Section~\ref{sec:DESPS1} and Figure~\ref{fig:drVSr}) strongly suggests that the
origin of this discrepancy is a bias in Gaia's Gmag photometry at the faint end, rather 
than a problem with SDSS catalog (offsets between the SDSS and DES
photometry are $<1-2$ millimag at Gmag$\sim$20.5). 
 

\begin{figure}[th!]
    \centering\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/GmagCorrectionTest_Gmag_Hess.png} 
\caption{The variation of the residuals between Gaia's Gmag from Data Release 2
and synthetic Gmag values generated using SDSS $gri$ photometry. The two solid 
lines represent the median values $\pm$ uncertainty of the median for each
0.05 mag wide Gmag bin. The short-dashed lines show the median values $\pm$ 
the robust standard deviation for each bin. The horizontal solid and long-dashed 
lines at zero and $\pm$0.01 mag, respectively, are added to guide the eye.
Note the jump by about 3 millimag at Gmag$\sim$16 -- this jump was a known and 
larger problem in Gaia Data Release 1, and apparently not entirely fixed in DR2. 
Note also large ($\sim0.01-0.02$ mag) discrepancy at the faint end -- a comparison 
of the SDSS catalog with Pan-STARRS and DES catalogs (see Figure~\ref{fig:drVSr}) 
suggests that its origin is a bias in Gaia's photometry at the faint end, rather than 
a problem with SDSS photometry.}
\label{fig:gaiaJump}
\end{figure}


Given these two features, we limit the calibration sample to the $16<$Gmag$<19.5$
magnitude range. We further restrict calibration stars to the $0.4 < g-i < 3.0$ color 
range (approximately A0 to M5 spectral range), yielding a sample of $\sim372,000$ stars. 
The behavior of median Gmag residuals per R.A. and Declination bin is shown in 
Figures~\ref{fig:graycorrRA} and \ref{fig:graycorrDec}.

median values $\pm$ uncertainty of the median for 1 degree wide R.A. bins. 
The short-dashed lines show the median values $\pm$ the robust standard 
deviation for each bin. The horizontal solid and long-dashed lines at zero and 
$\pm$0.01 mag, respectively, are added to guide the eye. The mean of the two 
solid lines is the gray correction, as a function of R.A., applied to the SDSS 
$ugriz$ magnitudes. The standard deviation for the applied correction is 3.5 millimag.}
\label{fig:graycorrRA}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[th!]
    \centering\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/GmagCorrection_Dec_Hess.png} 
\caption{Analogous to Figure~\ref{fig:graycorrRA}, except that here results are shown for
0.01 degree wide Declination bins. The 12 clearly visible regions correspond to
two SDSS scans (in R.A. direction) and six CCD columns in the SDSS camera. 
The standard deviation for the applied correction is 6.2 millimag, with a maximum
absolute value of $\sim0.01$ mag.}
\label{fig:graycorrDec}
\end{figure}


Except for a few degrees long region at the edge of Stripe 82 (R.A.$>$55 deg), the
SDSS photometric zeropoints are remarkably stable with respect to R.A.; the scatter
is only 3.5 millimag. On the other hand, there are clear deviations in Declination 
direction, which clearly map to the 12 scanning strips that fill Stripe 82. We note
that discrepancies never exceed 0.01 mag (with a scatter of 6.2 millimag), which was 
the claimed accuracy of the \pOc. Thanks to a large number of stars in the sample,
and well calibrated Gaia's photometric zeropoints across the sky, we can now 
constrain SDSS zeropoints with a precision of about 1 millimag per 0.01 degree
wide Declination bin. 

The residuals shown in Figures~\ref{fig:graycorrRA} and \ref{fig:graycorrDec} are
applied as ``gray'' zeropoint corrections to $ugriz$ magnitudes, as functions of 
R.A. and Declination, to all 991,472 stars in the catalog. This catalog version was
labeled v3.1, and it is publicly available\footnote{See http://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/sdss/catalogs/stripe82.html}. 

In the next re-calibration step, we derive synthetic $u-r$, $g-r$, $r-i$ and $r-z$ colors
from Gaia's BP-RP color, using the same binning procedure as we used above for 
Gmag$-r$ vs. $g-i$ variation (see Figure~\ref{fig:GrVSgi}). An example of color residuals 
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:riresid}.  The median residuals per R.A. and Declination bins 
are then used as zeropoint corrections for the $ugiz$ bands. We required that the median
offsets for all stars are vanishing and thus photometry in the new catalog is on the 
same AB scale as the old catalog (for related discussion, see Section~\ref{sec:AB}). 
The robust standard deviation for all zeropoint corrections is listed in Table~\ref{tab:GaiaRMS}.

\label{fig:riresid}
\end{figure}


The largest corrections were derived for the $u$ band. Given that Gaia's BP-RP
color does not strongly constrain the $u$ band flux, we used the CFIS catalog 
(see Section~\ref{ssec:cfis}) as an independent verification test. We verified that
zeropoint errors in the SDSS catalog implied by Gaia's and CFIS data agree at the
level a few millimags in Declination direction, but found $\sim$0.01-0.02 mag
large inconsistencies for R.A. bins. For this reason, we only applied $u$ band 
correction in Declination direction. The plausible $u$ band zeropoint errors in 
the new catalog are further discussed in Section~\ref{sec:CFIStest}. This final 
catalog version was labeled v3.4, and it is also publicly available.

\subsubsection{Validation of recalibration  \label{sec:SSCvsGaia}} 
  
By construction, the new v3.4 catalog should not show appreciable zeropoint residuals when 
binned by R.A. and Declination. We have verified this expectation for all colors used in 
recalibration. For illustration, Figure~\ref{fig:grVSgaiaRADec} shows such a test for the $g-r$ 
color, with binned median scatter of the order 1 millimag.

\subsection{Comparison of the SDSS v2.6 and v3.4 catalogs \label{sec:v26v34}} 
 
The v2.6 (``old'') SDSS Standard Star Catalog has been extensively used 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2008AJ....135..338F},
and here we briefly analyze differences between the v3.4 (``new'') and v2.6 magnitudes
to inform the future users about catalog consistency. 
In our analysis, we first compare v2.6 and v3.4 magnitudes of individual stars and 
bin the differences by R.A., Declination and magnitude. 

On average, both catalog versions are on the same magnitude scale (the median $ugriz$ 
magnitude differences for all stars are zero by construction). There are no systematic offsets 
when binned by magnitude, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:v26v34drr}. The most obvious 
differences appear when magnitude differences are binned by Declination. An example is 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:v26v34drDec}, where the periodicity of residuals corresponds to the 
field-of-view size for the SDSS Photometric Calibration Telescope \citep{2002AJ....123.2121S}. 
The standard deviation for median values per bin is 6.8 millimag, with extreme values about 
0.01 mag. It is likely that systematic errors in the calibration star network photometry 
were propagated through ``flat-field corrections'' discussed by \pO\ to the v2.6 catalog.
We note that these errors, now found thanks to Gaia catalogs, are well within the claimed
photemetric accuracy by both \pO\ and \cite{2002AJ....123.2121S}. The standard deviation 
for median values per bin for all bands and both coordinates is listed in Table~\ref{tab:oldnewRMS}.

Given the quality of Gaia photometry, there should be no doubt that SDSS $ugriz$ photometry
reported in the new v.3.4 catalog is superior to the old v2.6 catalog. Nevertheless, we perform
additional tests, based on the position of the stellar locus in the $g-r$ vs. $u-g$, $r-i$ vs. $g-r$ 
and $i-z$ vs. $r-i$ color-color diagrams  \citep{2004AN....325..583I}. The tests are based
on the second principal color for the blue part of the stellar locus, whose median should 
not deviate from zero by construction. Figure~\ref{fig:comparew} compares the behavior
of the $w$ color for the old v2.6 and new v3.4 catalog and demonstrates that the $gri$
photometry is better calibrated in the latter. The behavior of the $s$ and $y$ colors for the 
new catalog is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:comparesy}. {\it Based on these tests, we find that 
the contribution of the zeropoint errors is $<5$ millimag to $gri$ photometry, and 
$<10$ millimag for the $u$ and $z$ bands.}

\subsection{Comparison of the new v3.4 SDSS catalog with DES and Pan-STARRS catalogs \label{sec:DESPS1}} 
  
The quality of photometric zeropoint calibration for the new SDSS catalog can be conveniently
tested with the DES (see Section~\ref{ssec:des}) and Pan-STARRS (see Section~\ref{ssec:ps1}) catalogs. 
Both catalogs list $griz$ photometry of sufficient precision for esentially all stars
from Stripe 82. Their photometric calibration procedures are expected to result in different 
spatial patterns and thus a cross-comparison with the v3.4 catalog can reveal residual problems
with zeropoint calibration. They are also deeper than Gaia DR2 catalog and thus can provide
further clues about the Gmag discrepancy at Gaia's faint end illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:gaiaJump}. 

Our comparison of the magnitude differences is illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:DESPSRA} and \ref{fig:DESPSDec},
and the robust standard deviation for binned median magnitude differences is listed in Table~\ref{tab:DESPS1}. 
This multi-survey comparison indicates that the spatial variation of photometric zero points in the 
updated SDSS catalog is well below 0.01 mag (rms), with typical values of 3-7 millimag in the R.A. 
direction and 1-2 millimag in the Declination direction. As discernible in the two bottom panels
in Figure~\ref{fig:DESPSRA}, there are systematic residual errors in the $z$ band zeropoint as a 
function of  Declination at the level of a few millimag. Note also implied DES $z$ band zeropoint errors 
of up to 0.01-0.02 mag, as a function of R.A. (see the bottom left panel in Figure~\ref{fig:DESPSRA}). 

The variation of the magnitude differences
with magnitude (see Figure~\ref{fig:drVSr}) shows good agreement (to within $\sim$5 millimag) 
even at the faint end ($20<r<21$), where Gaia Gmag magnitudes appear too faint by about
0.02 mag, and thus demonstrates a likely problem with Gaia DR2 photometry.

\subsection{Comparison of the new v3.4 SDSS catalog and $u$ band data from the CFIS catalog  \label{sec:CFIStest}} 

The comparison of the new SDSS catalog with the DES and Pan-STARRS catalogs in the previous
section did not include the $u$ band. To assess the quality of $u$ band zeropoint calibration, 
we use the CFIS catalog (see Section~\ref{ssec:cfis}). The CFIS $u$ band photometry was 
calibrated using a combination of the SDSS, Pan-STARRS and GALEX UV data. Given that
we recalibrated the new SDSS catalog using Gaia data, for this comparison it shouldn't 
matter that SDSS data were used in calibration of the CFIS catalog. Nevertheless, the
results of this section should be treated with caution. 

A star-by-star comparison for about 150,000 sufficiently bright ($r<20$) blue ($1.0 <u-g < 2.1$) 
stars is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:CFIS}. The binned median scatter for Declination direction is 
5.7 millimag with systematic differences of up to about 0.01 mag. The constraints in R.A. direction 
are more noisy, with residuals appearing about twice as large as in Declination direction. 
These residuals compare favorably to the results of analysis by \cite{2017ApJ...848..128I}, 
who showed that some SDSS runs in Data Release 13 have $u$-band zeropoint errors as large
as 0.05 mag. 

 
\begin{figure}[th!]
    \centering\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/colorResidCFISug_Dec_Hess.png} 
\caption{Analogous to Figure~\ref{fig:graycorrDec}, except that here residuals 
between the SDSS $u$ band magnitudes and $u$ band magnitudes from the CFIS
catalog (corrected for small color terms, $\sim0.05$ mag, as a function of the $u-g$ color),
for $\sim$150,000 matched stars with $1.0 <u-g < 2.1$ and $r<20$ are shown. 
The binned median scatter is 5.7 millimag. Note that the CFIS data are available
only for Declination $>$ -0.45 degree.}

\subsection{Comparison of the new v3.4 SDSS catalog and transformed nUV data from the GALEX catalog  \label{sec:Galextest}} 

We also use the NUV magnitudes from GALEX (see Section~\ref{ssec:galex}) to provide an independent check on the SDSS u-band magnitudes, following the zeropoint corrections with Gaia photometry described in \S \ref{sec:GaiaCorr}. For this we derive 
GALEX to SDSS u transformation equations. Using GALEX NUV with SDSS (g,i) or with SDSS (r,i) yields the tightest GALEX to SDSS u transformation equation:
 
 \begin{equation}
 % \begin{multline}
 \begin{split}
  u_sdss = & NUV_{galex} + 0.939 \\
                  & - 1.008*(NUV_{galex} -- g_{sdss}) + 0.017*(NUV_{galex} -- g_{sdss})^2 \\
                  & -- 0.599*(g_{sdss} -- i_{sdss}) + 0.860*(g_{sdss} -- i_{sdss})^2
 \end{split}
%  \end{multline}
\end{equation}
 
Quality plots for this fit are shown in Figure \ref{fig:GalexQA} {\bf need to redo these plots in BW; select subplots to include}. The rms per star for this relation is 0.071 mag ? so still a bit noisy, but about as good as we think we can get for transforming GALEX to SDSS u (but see below regarding E(B-V)?).
 
 \begin{figure}[th!]
    \centering\includegraphics[width=14cm]{figures/Galex_QA.png}
\caption{{\bf  To be filled}} 
\label{fig:GalexQA}
\end{figure}
    
The quality plots for this fit can be found in the attached plot,
%%   sdss_galex_transform_u.20180614.norder2.niter3.uNUV.NUVg.gi_sdss.qa1.png
 
In the next plot,
%%  stripe82calibStars_v3.4_vs_GALEX_u-band_plot1.png ,
is plotted the 2D sky distribution of the matches, binned into 0.21-sq-deg healpixels, with each bin color coded to show the median difference between the SDSS $u_{mMed}$ mag and the GALEX-transformed $u_{mMed-est}$ in the healpixel.
 
The next plot,
%%  stripe82calibStars_v3.4_vs_GALEX_u-band_plot2.png ,
is the same as the previous plot, but now the healpixels are color coded by the median SFD98 E(B-V) in that healpixel.
Note that there is a slight correlation between these two plots.
 
In the final plot,
%%  stripe82calibStars_v3.4_vs_GALEX_u-band_plot3.png ,
the difference between the observed $u_{mMed}$ magtitude and the GALEX-transformed $u_{mMed-est}$ for each star is plotted against SFD98 E(B-V).    So it looks like the above GALEX à SDSS u-band transformation starts to break down for E(B-V) $>$ 0.15.  Maybe the next step would be including E(B-V) explicitly into the fit for the transformation equation.  Either that, or try a first attempt at the 2D figures using Zeljko?s jupyter notebooks.

\subsection{Offsets from AB magnitude scale \label{sec:AB}} 

We estimate offsets from AB magnitude scale using photometry for three DA white dwarfs observed by HST
(see Table~\ref{tab:HST}). XXX Doug expands this section, refers to G. Narayan et al. (2019) and other refs,
and other details explaining how synthetic ugriz photometry is generated for these three stars...

% From Doug's email: 
% As to the precision and accuracy of the synthetic mags, that is a little hard to quantify.  Narayan et al (2019) report 
% uncertainties for the synthetic magnitudes of the 2 DA’s from their sample at about 0.5% (5 milli-mags), but I don’t know if 
% that includes uncertainties in the reddening and in version of the SDSS filters used.  The HST CalSpec database (which 
% included GD50) is usually quoted as having an accuracy of about 1% (10 milli-mags) in the optical on average for any given 
% star in its database. 
% When I get observed DA WD spectra modeled by Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay (a former postdoc of Bergeron), he sends me not 
% only the best-fit model but also the +/-1sigma Teff, logg models as well.  When I calculate the synthetic mags for those, I
% usually get a spread of less than 1% in the resulting synthetic mags; so I think Gautham Narayan’s estimate of a statistical
% rms of 0.5% for his models is reasonable.  So maybe 0.5% (5 millimag) precision/statistical error, and c. 1% (10 milli-mags)
% accuracy/systematic error.

Table~\ref{tab:AB} presents numerical summary of the comparison between SDSS magnitudes 
and HST-based synthetic magnitudes for three white dwarfs. We used unweighted mean because 
formal uncertainties for SDSS photometry are subdominant to systematic errors in HST-based
synthetic magnitudes, estimated at about 0.01 mag. Uncertainty of the mean offsets was 
computed from the observed scatter of three values. In the $riz$ bands we detect significant
($>3\sigma$) deviations, ranging from 0.015 mag to 0.035 mag, while in the $u$ and $g$ bands 
we can only place upper limits (at $2\sigma$: 0.038 mag and 0.028 mag, respectively).
